# Elasticsearch check example
This is an example check for elasticsearch. This check will search in all indices
for entries with type:sysqlog. It will also filter the result to only show the
last 24 hours.

    {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": {
            "wildcard": { "type": "syslog" }
          },
          "filter": {
            "range" : {
              "@timestamp" : {
                "gte" : "now-1d",
                "lt" :  "now"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
